# bid_auction
This is basically looping through dictinorie using while,to find the highest bid by the bidders where bid is the value and bidders are names
by defining fun() we calculate the highest bid in the dictionary{} and we print it....if there are no bidders just stop although it continues therefore you can  import clear module and use clear() instead of printing stop .
